    "Title: Streamlit and SimpleAI Cryptorithmetic Puzzle Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In order to solve cryptarithmetic puzzles, the offered code is a Python script that makes use of the Streamlit framework and the SimpleAI module. In cryptarithmetic exercises, the digits of some numbers are represented by letters, with each letter standing in for a different digit. The objective of the code is to identify a legitimate pairing of digits and letters that will satisfy a particular mathematical equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Streamlit Setup: The code begins by creating a title and a centered layout for the Streamlit page.\n",
    "        The user is given a description of cryptarithmetic puzzles and an example puzzle.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Streamlit Setup: The code begins by creating a title and a centered layout for the Streamlit page.\n",
    "        The user is given a description of cryptarithmetic puzzles and an example puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    User input: A \"Try out your puzzle\" button is visible, allowing the user to start the puzzle-solving process.\n",
    "        When the button is clicked, a form where the user can enter their cryptarithmetic puzzle is presented. The input is anticipated to be a mathematical equation with letters standing in for the digits.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    The code separates the user's input into words and pulls out distinctive characters from each word. The variables to which the digits will be assigned are these letters.\n",
    "    A \"launch\" button is also included on the input form so the user can submit the puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem with Constraint Satisfaction (CSP):\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code creates a CSP problem to answer the puzzle after the user submits it.\n",
    "    It gives each variable a domain (which is initially set to 0‚Äì9 for all), according to the range of values for each letter.\n",
    "    The variable domains at the start of words have been modified to [1-9], preventing them from having the value 0.\n",
    "Constraint Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two constraints are defined for the CSP problem:\n",
    "        constraint_unique: This constraint ensures that each assigned value to a variable is unique.\n",
    "        constraint_add: This constraint checks if the sum of the first two words (represented by letters) is equal to the result word (represented by letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraint Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The defined constraints are applied to the CSP problem, ensuring that the solution adheres to the rules of cryptarithmetic puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code uses the backtrack function from the SimpleAI library to find solutions to the CSP problem.\n",
    "    Multiple solutions may exist, and the code iterates through all of them.\n",
    "Results Presentation: \n",
    "        \n",
    "        The code shows the puzzle's answers, along with each variable's assigned digit.\n",
    "        The user may be shown many solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    By inputting a cryptologic puzzle in the available input form and hitting the \"launch\" button, the user engages with the code.\n",
    "    The code then makes an effort to identify legitimate answers to the puzzle based on the constraints and displays these answers to the user.\n",
    " \n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The algorithm has limits because of the way CSP works and the way that digits are assigned, even though it can solve many cryptarithmetic puzzles.\n",
    "    It is impossible to utilize puzzles like \"SEND + MORE\" in this code. \n",
    "\n",
    "USE of AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I modelled and solved cryptographic challenges using AI (Chatgpt, Bing AI) in the form of CSP and constraint definitions. \n",
    "    I did, however, recognise the drawbacks of this strategy for some problems, notably ones with unusual solutions like \"SEND + MORE.\" When utilizing the application, users should be aware of these limitations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     \n",
    "input used in chatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        use constraint_add method to add the values from the domains of the keys should match the the last element get each index in the last the last element in the  new_input add them respectively.\n",
    " \n",
    "conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        With the help of the given code, users can input cryptarithmetic puzzles and apply a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) technique to find solutions. It successfully showcases the usage of the SimpleAI library for CSP problem solving and Streamlit for generating a user interface. It is a helpful tool for solving cryptarithmetic puzzles interactively since users can input their riddles and examine multiple solutions.\n",
